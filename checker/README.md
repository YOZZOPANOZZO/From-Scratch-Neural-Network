# Python Checker

We'll use this file to create the NN in python, so that we can use it to check the results of the Rust implementation.

Run the following command to run the code AFTER MOVED TO THE `checker` DIRECTORY:
```
python3.11 -m venv checker-env #use version 3.11
source checker-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then open main.ipynb

To exit the env, run:
```
deactivate
```
